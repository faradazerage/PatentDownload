# PatentDownload

This is a simple Python script that makes it easy to download multiple patents into a single folder

chmod 755 extract.py
./extract.py [patent file]

Right now, it only supports US Patents and Applications
Format should be:

US XXXXXXXXXXX A1 -> for Applications 

and

US XXXXXXX B -> for Patents
